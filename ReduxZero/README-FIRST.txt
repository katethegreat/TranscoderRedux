This is the source code for a video converter program called ReduxZero.
It's a new program, ready for others to give it a new life.

FilmRedux is where any real work should be focused. ReduxZero (though it DOES work nicely as-is) is best as a history lesson for completing FilmRedux.

From an educational standpoint, there are probably some really neat AppleScript Studio things done here (and probably some really dumb things done here too). Insight is free for all.

Try to get revisions from early 2008 if possible.
Other binaries are included due to their rarity, or were heavily-modified without tracks.
