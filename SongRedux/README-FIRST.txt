This is the source code for an audio converter program called SongRedux.
It's a new program, ready for others to give it a new life.

It's functionally complete, and will provide you with hours of enjoyment.

From an educational standpoint, there are probably some really neat AppleScript Studio things done here (and probably some really dumb things done here too). Insight is free for all.

Additional things needed:
ffmpeg - http://www.ffmpeg.org - See the diff included for the necessary revision and changes made
AtomicParsley - http://atomicparsley.sourceforge.net
mov123 - included here 'cause it's hard to find
qt_tools - http://www.omino.com/sw/qt_tools
SetFile and afconvert - Xcode dev tools
normalize - http://normalize.nongnu.org/
tagreader and tagwriter - http://developer.kde.org/~wheeler/taglib.html - Included versions are heavily modified

Try to get revisions from early 2008 if possible.
Other binaries are included due to their rarity, or were heavily-modified without tracks.
